# Chacha Chaudhary: AI-Powered Mascot for Namami Gange

## Project Overview
Chacha Chaudhary has been declared the mascot of the Namami Gange Programme at the 37th Executive Committee meeting of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). In collaboration with Diamond Toons, NMCG is developing and distributing comics, e-comics, and animated videos to foster behavioral change among children regarding the Ganga and other rivers.

## Problem Statement
To further enhance interactivity, the project aims to create an AI, ML, and chatbot-powered interactive robot mascot (Chacha Chaudhary). This solution will strengthen the river-people connect component of Namami Gange by engaging school children, the general public, and all NMCG stakeholders, promoting awareness and information dissemination in a user-friendly and citizen-centric manner.

## Solution
An interactive robot named “Chacha Chaudhary” will serve as the AI, ML, and chatbot-enabled mascot of Namami Gange. Equipped with a touch panel, the robot will greet visitors at the entrance and guide them through each component of the Namami Gange flagship program in the River Basin War Room & Ganga Museum. The digital avatar of Chacha Chaudhary will also be available on the NMCG website.

The Robot Mascot (Chacha Chaudhary) and digital avatar solution will actively engage citizens, imparting information, awareness, and education about riverine ecology through interactive digital and outdoor installations.

## Prerequisites
- The robot should operate independently to connect with school children, the general public, and all NMCG stakeholders.

## Features
- AI, ML, and chatbot-powered interactive robot mascot
- Touch panel interface for user interaction

## Objective

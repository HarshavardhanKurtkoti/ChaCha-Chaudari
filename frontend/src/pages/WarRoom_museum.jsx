					The museum at Chandi Ghat, Haridwar is a collaborative effort of NMCG and the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Apart from showcasing Ganga riverâ€™s glory, the museum also provides information on the issues of Ganga conservation and the initiatives taken up by the Ministry of Jal Shakti to rejuvenate the River. The bilingual mode of narration of the museum will be instrumental in communicating the message across the masses, right from the local people to the international tourists. The museum will contribute immensely in spreading awareness in view of its location in Haridwar, a pilgrimage city and the site for the Kumbh mela in 2021.
